Abstractâ€”This study introduces a Multi-Scale Attention ResNet Model for the assisted diagnosis of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Utilizing deep learning techniques, the model enhances neural networks via a residual learning framework to prevent gradient vanishing, thus improving classification accuracy and recognition rates. Specifically tailored for 12-lead ECG data, the model employs multi-scale convolution and channel attention mechanisms to accurately analyze cardiac data. Capable of identifying common cardiac conditions as well as handling complex or ambiguous cases, the model also integrates patient information to enhance classification performance. Serving as an efficient tool for managing extensive data in clinical diagnostics, this model is anticipated to become a pivotal technology in clinical diagnostics and telemedicine.
